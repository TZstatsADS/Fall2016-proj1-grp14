This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
```{r}
load("C:/Users/wc254/Downloads/data.RData")
attach(df)
names(df)
raw=split(NOC,HHL)
mean=rep(0,5)
Mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}
mode=rep(0,5)

for(i in 1:5){
  mean[i]=mean(raw[[i]])
  mode[i]=Mode(raw[[i]])
}

barplot(mean)
names(mode)=c("1","2","3","4","5")
names(mean)=c("1","2","3","4","5")
barplot(mode)
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

In this project, we are interested in what factors will affect the number of children. So based on the household data, we choose varibles like State, family type and employment status, languages spoken in the family, household income. In addtion, we combined several variables like water fees to represent living costs.
