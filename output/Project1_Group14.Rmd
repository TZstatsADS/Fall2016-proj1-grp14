```{r}
load("C:/Users/wc254/Downloads/data.RData")
attach(df)
names(df)
raw=split(NOC,HHL)
mean=rep(0,5)
Mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}
mode=rep(0,5)

for(i in 1:5){
  mean[i]=mean(raw[[i]])
  mode[i]=Mode(raw[[i]])
}

barplot(mean)
names(mode)=c("1","2","3","4","5")
names(mean)=c("1","2","3","4","5")
barplot(mode)
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
