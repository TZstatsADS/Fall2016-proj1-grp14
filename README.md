+ Project summary: In this project, we have centered our exploratory data analysis around a segment of our population, families with children. We'll be investigating interesting topics such as factors that influence the number of children, states with abnormally high or low number of children and much more. Given our American community surveys on individual households, we've choosen numeric and categorical variables like Residing State, family type and employment status, languages spoken in the family and household income. Additionally, we have also created artifical new variables that extract and combind valuable information.
